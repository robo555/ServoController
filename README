This is an embedded computing project for the MSP430 microcontroller.

The program enables UART pins, reads the signal and translate it to PWM signals for controller servos.
This was used to control the steering and throttle of the Tamiya TT-01 RC car.

The program is interrupt based so there is program loop when idle,
allowing it to enter low power mode at each iteration, and wakes up at the next interrupt.

On the other side of the equation, the UART signals are sent by a Raspberry Pi setup as a wireless hot spot.
This allows any platform to connect to the Raspberry Pi via Wi-Fi to control the RC car.

The setup can be seen in action here:
